      You'll need this tag at the beginning of every HTML document you create.
      It ensures that a <br />browser knows that it's reading HTML, and that it
      expects HTML5, the latest version. <br /><br />Even though this is't
      actually an HTML tag, it's still a good one to know.
    </p>
    <h2>2.&lt;html&gt;</h2>
    <hr size="3" color="black" />
    <p>
      This is another tag that tells a browser that it's reading HTML. The
      &lt;/html&gt; tag goes <br />straight after the DOCUTYPE tag, and you
      close it with a &lt;/html&gt; tag right at the end of your <br />file.
      Everything else in your document goes between these tags.
    </p>
    <h2>3.&lt;head&gt;</h2>
    <hr size="3" color="black" />
    <p>
      The &lt;head&gt; tag starts the header section of your file. The stuff
      that goes in here doesn't <br />appear on your webpage. Instead, it
      contains metadata for search engines, and info for <br />your browser.
